Case Study
The client:
Our current client is a well-established real estate company that primarily operates in the Southern Region states of the US such as Texas, Oklahoma, New Mexico, 
Louisiana. 
But in this consulting project, we will focus our efforts only in the state of Texas. 
The company offers relocation and housing advice as well as price estimates to customers in multiple Texas cities as well as Metropolitan Statistical areas. 

The Problem:
Our client is going through some restructuration and would like to incorporate the newest sets of technologies such as artificial intelligence and robotic process 
automation as part of its rebranding efforts in order to better serve its customers and help them optimize their housing and pricing options. 
The company faces some challenges when onboarding and accommodating its new customers or even its existing customers, their current processes in place often follow 
some manual conventions and also involve multiple verification steps. 
Overall, it can be time-consuming, and many resources are utilized which in turn affects the organization both financially and from a human resources perspective 
such as a employee high turnover. 
On top that, customer retention is heavily affected.

The solution:
Our team of consultants has been hired to build machine learning algorithms that would help the company ease its process by automating certain processes and help 
its customers in real-time, thus bypassing the multiple steps verification methods but most importantly help identify the hidden correlations in the data that 
could help in fairly predicting the housing prices for customers and give options to customers. 
Multiple variables such as average sales prices, crime reported as well as number of schools and hospitals located in the area can help build a model to estimate 
a fair housing price in a given region or area.
